# VPRMTZ NFT Gallery
*"An on-chain gallery of visualized prompts, blending AI creativity with blockchain provenance."*

## About
The **VPRMTZ NFT Gallery** showcases 19 unique artworks from the *Visualized Prompts* collection. Inspired by Jimmy Edgar's randomized text prompts from the VOID project, these visuals were generated and curated to capture the surreal, dreamlike qualities embedded in the text. Each NFT is enriched with embedded metadata, including titles, descriptions, attributes, and the original text prompts.

This project was created as a celebration of AI-generated art, blockchain provenance, and the collaborative spirit of Web3.
